  - name: V-Hyper
    description: >-
      V-Hyper stands for Hyperspectral Vision.
        The project aims at improving the spatial and spectral resolution of snapshot hyperspectral cameras
        via multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion techniques. The goal is to build a real multi-camera
        demonstrator with cameras possessing complementary spatial and spectral characteristics.
